# Hack CU 8 Project : Use Case

It is hard to keep up with friends and family when we all have busy lives. It is important to maintain connections with those you care about. Use our re-connect application to get email reminders to check-in with people in your contacts list. Manually add duration between contact points, and view those who you have reminders for. Infrastructure built on Python using Flask and mySQL.

Collaborators: Justin Lee, Ryan Slocum, Abby Nacional, Ansh Jhatakia
